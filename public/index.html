    <p class="profileParagraph">Hello, My name is Oscar and I am a fourth-year college student majoring in Computer
      Science
      at New Jersey Institute of Technology. My career goal is to become a Software Engineer. Ever since I was young I always enjoyed
      computers and to problem solve
      so deciding to study CS felt natural. Over the course of these past years I have immersed myself into the field,
      and consistently
      improving as a developer and student.</p>
